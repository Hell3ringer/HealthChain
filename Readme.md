# Blockchain in health records confidentiality	

- We have two kinds of Users - Doctors and Patients
- A transaction involves a doctor and a patient
- For simplicity we have implemented zero knowledge proof for only patients
- All the keywords, usernames used are case sensitive
- Initially blockchain is empty
- Atleast one patient has to be registered before adding or viewing a transaction
- Operations should be performed in the following order (initially):
		register-->add-->view

 > If using a java ide, go to src and run

> If using terminal to run then change directory to its src:                                                                                       
> To compile use: javac users.java StringUtil.java Record.java Block.java Main.java                   
> To run use    : java Main
